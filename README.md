# Just Joinmarket

A basic script which builds a Docker image based on a given [Joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver) 
version and uploads it to a [DockerHub Repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/thebitcoinprof/just-joinmarket)

The version of the docker image corresponds with the Joinmarket version that was used.
